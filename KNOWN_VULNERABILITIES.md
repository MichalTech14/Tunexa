## Current Status: 1 Moderate Severity Issue

### validator.js URL validation bypass (GHSA-9965-vmph-33xx)

**Severity:** Moderate  
**Package:** validator.js  
**Affected:** express-validator, swagger-jsdoc dependencies  
**Status:** Awaiting safe fix

**Description:**
validator.js has a URL validation bypass vulnerability in its isURL function.

**Impact Assessment:**
- **Low Risk for Tunexa:** This vulnerability affects URL validation
- We use express-validator primarily for input sanitization
- URL validation is not critical path in our audio certification system
- No direct user-submitted URLs are validated in production

**Mitigation:**
1. Monitoring Dependabot for safe update
2. Additional input validation layers in place
3. CORS and request filtering configured
4. Not using isURL() function in critical paths

**Action Plan:**
- [ ] Monitor for non-breaking update from express-validator team
- [ ] Review all uses of URL validation in codebase
- [ ] Add additional validation layer if URLs are accepted
- [ ] Consider alternative validation library if fix delayed

**Fix Available:**
```bash
npm audit fix --force
```
⚠️ **WARNING:** This is a BREAKING CHANGE and may break existing code.

**Recommended Action:**
Wait for express-validator team to release non-breaking update, or test `--force` fix in development environment first.
