## 🔬 Test Methodology

- **Tool:** Custom Node.js performance test suite
- **Method:** Multiple sequential requests (10x per endpoint)
- **Metrics:** Latency, throughput, consistency (std dev)
- **Thresholds:**
  - ⚡ Excellent: < 50ms
  - ✅ Good: < 100ms  
  - ⚠️ Acceptable: < 200ms
  - ❌ Poor: > 200ms

---

## 📝 Notes

- Tests performed on local development server
- Production deployment may have additional network latency
- Results represent server-side processing time only
- Cold start overhead (30ms) occurs only on first request
- Subsequent requests benefit from warm cache (0-5ms)
